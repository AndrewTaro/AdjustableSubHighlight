# Adjustable Submarine Highlight
The submarines are highlighted with red when they are underwater.  
However, the color does not change even if the color-blind settings are enabled, making people with these difficulties suffer.

This mod resolves it and provides further settings to modify the highlight color for each depth and lock-on state.
